<h1>Chapter 4. Migrating from Tivoli NetView for z/OS <br/>
     V6R1</h1>

<p>When you are migrating from the Tivoli NetView for z/OS V6R1, you can either add the V6R3 content into
 your V6R1 NetView definitions, or add your V6R1 customization to the default V6R3 members supplied 
with the NetView program. Either way, place the customized member into an appropriate user-allocated 
data set such as NETVIEW.V6R3USER.CNM01.DSIPARM. Do not customize members in the SMP/E- 
managed data sets such as NETVIEW.V6R3M0.DSIPARM.</p>

<p><b>Usage note:</b> The migration information is based on the NetView components that are supplied with the 
initial release of V6R3. Review your maintenance to see if you already made some of the changes.</p>

<p>Several factors can influence the method that you use when migrating your NetView definition members. 
Factors such as the size and complexity of your network, security policies that must be followed, and 
established practices within your business can all influence what is the best method for your migration.
 The checklist that follows details the documented method of migration as outlined in this book and 
supported by other books in the NetView library. Choose the method of migration that is best for you.</p>

<p>Do the following steps to migrate your V6R1 definitions:</p>

<ol>

<li>Allocate a new set of V6R3 user data sets by running the CNMSJ002 sample job. You did this when you 
completed the steps in Table 12 on page 16.</li>

<li>Define a unique &NV2I value (xx) for each NetView domain.</li>

<li>Review your customized V6R1 copy of the CNMSTYLE member. If you did not already do so, move all 
of your domain-specific customization of V6R1 CNMSTYLE statements into the CxxSTGEN member 
and all of your system-wide customization of V6R1 CNMSTYLE statements into the CNMSTUSR
 member. Do not copy your V6R1 CNMSTYLE member into the V6R3 user DSIPARM data set.</li>

<li>Review the CNMSTYLE information in this chapter and the V6R3 CNMSTNXT member that is included 
with the NetView program. Place any domain-specific customization of CNMSTYLE statements into the 
CxxSTGEN member and any system-wide customization of CNMSTYLE statements into the CNMSTUSR 
member. Do not modify the V6R3 default CNMSTYLE member.</li>

<li>Review the remaining information in this chapter, and migrate your V6R1 NetView definition members 
and JCL procedures as appropriate, placing only those members that were modified into the V6R3 
user data sets.</li>

</ol>

<p>Figure 3 on page 63 shows the NetView V6R3 initialization flow. Keep this new initialization flow in mind 
as you make changes to your DSIPARM members.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Review CNMSTNXT to see statement changes made to CNMSTYLE members for NetView V6R3 
program.</p>

<p>For changes by release, including changed panels, commands, messages, and samples, see the following 
appendixes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Appendix A, “Changes from Tivoli NetView for z/OS V6R1 to Tivoli NetView for z/OS V6R2,” on page 113</li>
<li>Appendix B, “Changes from Tivoli NetView for z/OS V6R2 to Tivoli NetView for z/OS V6R2M1,” on page
 129</li>

 you made into the appropriate V6R3 member.</p>

<p><b>Usage note:</b> You can add Data REXX logic to conditionally define operator definitions in DSIOPFU. Data
 REXX files must have either /*%DATA*/ or /*%LOGIC*/ as the first statement. Comments can follow on
 the same or subsequent lines. A blank in the first column indicates a continuation of the previous

previous version of the DSIRXPRM module. As of NetView V6R2, the NetView program is not compatible
 with previous versions of the DSIRXPRM module.</dd>
<dd>Define the previously added REXX initialization parameters as follows:</dd>
<ul>
<li>If you previously added REXX command environments or REXX function package names to the
 DSIRXPRM module, migrate those changes to the CNMSTYLE (CNMSTUSR or CxxSTGEN) member by

<br/><br/>

<li>If you previously added other REXX initialization parameters to the DSIRXPRM module, merge those 
changes into the V6R3 version of CNMSJM11. Ensure that you deleted the earlier version of the
 DSIRXPRM module, and then run CNMSJM11 to assemble and link edit your changes into the

 DSIRXPRM module.</li>

<p><b>Note:</b> You must delete the earlier version of the DSIRXPRM module because it was link edited with the
 RENT attribute whereas the current version is link edited with the REUS attribute.</p>

<li>If you previously added the system REXX function package for IBM Z System Automation to the
 DSIRXPRM module, drop the modified DSIRXPRM module from your environment. The System
 
Automation INGRXFPG REXX function package is loaded automatically when the SA tower is enabled. If 
necessary, use the previous migration steps to include other System Automation REXX function
 packages.</li>

 NetView initialization, the DWO093W warning message is issued by the NetView program.</dd>

<dd><b>Important:</b> If you modify the DSITBL01 automation table, consider that many of the statements are used 
in the normal operation of the NetView program.</dd>

<dd>Several messages that are supplied by the NetView product have changed. These messages are listed in 
the appendixes. Review the list and make any necessary changes to your automation table.</dd>
<dd>You can add your own automation table by using the AUTOCMD statement in the CNMSTUSR or
 CxxSTGEN member. Place your automation table before the DSITBL01 automation table and code
 CONTINUE(YES) on any local customization to make sure that messages flow to the DSITBL01
 automation table. For more information on the AUTOCMD statement, refer to the IBM Z NetView
 Administration Reference.</dd>

<dt><h3>DSIZVLSR</h3></dt>

 inbound connections to the server. If AT-TLS is not configured for the NetView Web Services server and
 the CNMSTYLE NVSP.srvrname.SECURE statement is set to YES, all inbound connections are rejected.
 See information about controlling the access to the Web Services Gateway function in the Security
 Reference.</dd>

<dt><h3>IBM Z NetView and IBM Z NetView Enterprise Management Agent Versions</h3></dt>

<dd>The IBM Z NetView Enterprise Management Agent (NetView agent) requires Tivoli Management Services
 V6.3.0 Fixpack 7. If you are not currently running at this level, upgrade the following components to the
 V6.3.0 Fixpack 7 level before you install the NetView agent:</dd>
<br/>
<dd>•	Tivoli Enterprise Portal desktop client<br/>
•	Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server<br/>
•	Hub Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server</dd>
<br/>
<dd>The NetView program is the data source for the NetView agent. Because of this, both the NetView
 program and the NetView agent must be at the V6R3 level.</dd>
<br/>
<dd>Before upgrading the NetView agent, review the IBM OMEGAMON and Tivoli Management Services on z/OS
 shared documentation Upgrade Guide. The general order of upgrade procedures documented for the
 OMEGAMON XE V5.1 and later monitoring agents also applies to the NetView agent</dd>
<br/>
<dd>Prior to IBM Tivoli Monitoring V6.2.3, before an agent could connect to a Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring
 Server, you were required to manually update the monitoring server (and other Tivoli Management
 Services components such as the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server and the Tivoli Data Warehouse) with
 information necessary for the monitoring server to recognize and process data sent by that agent. As of
 V6.2.3, this seeding step becomes unnecessary. The NetView agent has been enhanced with the optional
 self-description feature that automatically distributes the operating configuration directly to the local 
monitoring server, which then distributes those agent configuration files first to the hub monitoring server 
(if necessary) and then to the various IBM Tivoli Monitoring components that require it.</dd>

<dd>For a list of changes to the NetView agent, see the following information:</dd>
<br/>
<dd>•	For changes made in Version 6.2.1, see “Enterprise Management Agent Changes” on page 150.</dd>
<br/>
<dd>•	For changes made in Version 6.2, see “Enterprise Management Agent Changes” on page 122.</dd>
